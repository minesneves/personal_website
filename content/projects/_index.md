## PhD project

My PhD project focuses on schistosomiasis, a debilitating Neglected Tropical Disease caused by parasitic worms called schistosomes and affects more than 200 million people worldwide. During the past three years, I have been developing statistical and mathematical models to further understand the population biology and transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis, under supervision of [Dr. Martin Walker](https://www.rvc.ac.uk/about/our-people/martin-walker) and [Prof. Joanne Webster](https://www.rvc.ac.uk/about/our-people/joanne-webster).
My PhD is based at the [Royal Veterinary College](https://www.rvc.ac.uk/) and is affiliated with the [London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease Research](https://www.londonntd.org/research/researchers/maria-inês-neves).

## Previous projects

The aim of my Master of Research was to investigate [the transmission dynamics of *Campylobacter jejuni* among broilers in semi-commercial farms in Jordan.](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/transmission-dynamics-of-campylobacter-jejuni-among-broilers-in-semicommercial-farms-in-jordan/10CA326BD60A195A19BE1E9B3E3742DC) Campylobacter is the leading cause of foodborne bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide and is commonly associated with chicken consumption. In this work, statistical approaches were used to quantify the transmission rate of Campylobacter in broilers within the farm, the day when the flock first became infected, and the within-flock prevalence at the end of the cycle. This work was conducted at the Royal Veterinary College, under supervision of Dr. Matteo Crotta and Prof. Javier Guitian.

During my Veterinary Medicine degree, I became interested in epidemiology and the transmission dynamics of animal and human diseases, which led me to pursue an MRes and a PhD in mathematical and statistical epidemiology. My thesis was conducted at the Technical University of Denmark, under supervision of Dr. Maarten Nauta, and focused on [comparing and evaluating outputs from deterministic and stochastic consumer phase models for quantitative risk assessment of foodborne diseases.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235235221730107X)

## MedTech

In addition to my research, I have various interests in health technology development. Recently, I was awarded £36,000 to participate in the [MedTech SuperConnector Challenge Accelerator](www.medtechsuperconnector.com), a Programme that provides funding, training and mentorship to early career researchers for the development of entrepreneurial ventures. I am currently working with a small team of developers, designers and researchers to develop a web application to support wellbeing and mental health in veterinary students.
