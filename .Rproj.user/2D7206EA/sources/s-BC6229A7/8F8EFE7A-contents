I'm Inês, a PhD student working on the population biology and transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis, under supervision of Dr. Martin Walker and Prof. Joanne Webster. During my research degrees, I have been using computational and statistical models to solve complex issues at the Human-Animal-Ecosystem Interface. In addition to my research, I am interested in healthcare innovation and am working on the development of a web application to promote wellbeing in veterinary students.
